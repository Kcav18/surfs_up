# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustaibable year-round in Oahu. An investor, W. Avy, specifically requested Oahu temperature data for the months of June and December before deciding on opening up the surf shop.

This analysis consisted of two technical deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Determine the summary statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the summary statistics for December.
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

## Results

- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3

*The code used to determine the summary statistics for both June and December are shown below.*

## Summary
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
