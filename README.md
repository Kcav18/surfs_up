# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustaibable year-round in Oahu. An investor, W. Avy, specifically requested Oahu temperature data for the months of June and December before deciding on opening up the surf shop.

This analysis consisted of two technical deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Determine the summary statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the summary statistics for December.
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

## Results

- The average temperature for the month of June is approximately 75 degrees. The average temperature for the month of December is 71 degrees.
- The minimum temperature for the month of June is aproximately 64 degrees. The minimum temperature for the month of December is 56 degrees.
- The maximimum temperature for the month of June is 85 degrees. The maximum temperature for the month of December is 83 degrees.

*The code used to determine the summary statistics for both June and December are shown below.*

## Summary

This analysis indicates that opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is absolutely sustainable year-round. The summary statistics proves that temperatures in June and December do not drastically differ. The largest variation is the minimum temperature but even then, some people still like ice cream during that time - I know my kids sure do! I believe that W. Avy can invest in this business with pure confidence. 

Some additional queries that could be used to gather even more weather data for June and December are as follows:
